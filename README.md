The purpose of this documentation is to help provide users with information about our project and how to navigate through it.

The data that was used in this project was provided by a free to use Valorant API (url below).

https://valorant-api.com/

When the page is loaded, the user will be taken to a home page with a basic description of the Valorant video game provided by Wikipedia, as well as, a youtube trailer found on the official valorant youtube channel.

Each tab is a seperate aspect of the game:

-Agents tab contains a list of all the possible characters(agents) that a player can choose from. Each agent has unique abilities that seperate them out from the others. Within the tab you can see the images of each agent, when you hover your mouse over you will see the name of said agent displayed below. If you click on the image you will see a full description along with the abilities of each agent. In order to exit out of the agent information you must double click the image.

-The Game Modes tab contains a list of all the possible game modes as well as the duration of each match and a dewcription of the game mode itself.

-The Maps tab works similarly with the agents tab in that within the tab is a list of all maps currently available in the game. If you click on each map name you will see a mini map, an overview of the map and the co-ordinates that were all provided by the API. Like the agents tab, in order to retract the map information you must double click.

-The weapons tab also follows similar functionality. Each weapon is listed out by image and by name. By clicking on the image we get a display of the weapon stats, cost, etc. In order to retract the information you need to double click.
